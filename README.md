## 📱 About

The **Fábrica de Sites** approach uses a **single source of truth configuration pattern** — all client-specific content (business name, colors, contact info, services, opening hours) lives in a single config file. Switching clients requires minimal code changes.

**Key features:**
- Appointment booking flow
- Admin dashboard
- PIX payment module
- SEO-ready structure
- Google Search Console integration (Ploter.com case)
- Continuous deployment via Vercel
